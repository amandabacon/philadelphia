Philadelphia
============
Philadelphia is a shift report system for the SNO+ experiment, intended to succeed the Manhattan system used by SNO.

Throughout a shift, detector operators are obligated to measure and record certain detector parameters and note observed conditions. Philadelphia makes this easy for the operators by providing freely-modifiable templates for standard tasks. It is designed to structure data just enough to be queryable, while allowing the arbitrary supplemental data to be added.
